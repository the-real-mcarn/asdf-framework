# asdf-games

Me making games using HTML5 Games: Novice to Ninja by Sitepoint. 
[You can find the book here.](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/html5-games-novice-to-ninja)

The projects here are very similar to those featured in the book, and it will take some time before I get to make my own game.

To try out asdf library and the projects for yourself, you need to:
* Download node.js
* Clone this repository
* Go the the folder where you cloned this repository
* Run startHTTP.bat or run
```
node list.js --dir ./
```

Releases will be featured on
